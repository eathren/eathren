# Hi there, I'm Nolan ðŸ‘‹

### A little bit about me:

- âš¡ I've been a professional **Software Engineer** since 2018, specializing in JavaScript (JS), TypeScript (TS),  Python, and Rust. I currently work as a senior product engineer building KG data vis systems.
- ðŸŽ“ Graduated with a **Master of Science in Computer Science (MSCS)** from **Northeastern University**.
- ðŸŒ± Currently, I'm deeply involved in my passion project, **Zenote**. I'm working on building an custom immediate rendering library for 100,000+ node/edges visualizations.

**Looks a little breezy in here**
So I admit, my old work leaves me a bit embarrassed to share so they're all set to private, while the new stuff I'm passionate about I'm trying to develop into a full-blown business, and am keeping the source code  private (for now). I'm working on some examples to show my expertise in JavaScript, Python, and Rust however, just to show I know what I'm doing :^).
