# Hi there, I'm Nolan ðŸ‘‹

## A little bit about me:

- âš¡ I've been a professional **Software Engineer** since 2018, specializing in JavaScript (JS), TypeScript (TS),  Python, and Rust. I currently work as a senior product engineer building KG data vis systems.
- ðŸŽ“ Graduated with a **Master of Science in Computer Science (MSCS)** from **Northeastern University**.
- ðŸŒ± Currently, I'm deeply involved in my passion project, **Zenote.net**. I'm working on building an custom immediate rendering library for 100,000+ node/edges visualizations.

## Let's Talk Code...

I primarily write code with a purpose. After several years of experience as a developer, I've come to value the importance of the work I produce. It's somewhat unusual in our industry that while businesses can profit from copy-pasting solutions, developers are expected to freely share their code. 

If you're interested in any of my projects, feel free to reach out. I'm always open to discussing my work in a one-on-one conversation over video. You can reach me easiest on LinkedIn.
