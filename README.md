# Hi there, I'm Nolan ðŸ‘‹

## A little bit about me:

- âš¡ I've been a professional **Software Engineer** since 2018, specializing in JavaScript (JS), TypeScript (TS),  Python, and Rust. I currently work as a senior product engineer building KG data vis systems.
- ðŸŽ“ Graduated with a **Master of Science in Computer Science (MSCS)** from **Northeastern University**.
- ðŸŒ± Currently, I'm deeply involved in my passion project, **Zenote**. I'm working on building an custom immediate rendering library for 100,000+ node/edges visualizations.

### Looks a little breezy in here...  

I mainly write code that makes money. After a number of years of working as a developer, I grew a bit tired of sharing my hard work for free. It's actually rather strange for the culture, that for one of the few professions where businesses can be copy-pasted, we're expected to supply the code to the public. 

If you're curious about something I've built, ask about it. I'm always happy to chat in a one on one over video.
